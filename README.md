# TrafficMonitor
An Android app that exploits the side channel presented in the paper "Location Leakage from Network Access Patterns"

We provide the source files for the app (files that would be present in the /app/src/main/java/{app_name} folder on Android Studio)

We provide two versions of the app--one with a UI (NetworkMonitorThreadRealDevice) and one without a UI (NetworkMonitorThreadEmulator). The UI is not necessary, it just makes it easier to conduct experiments on real device. 

Instructions on how to enable/disable the UI mode of the app are provided within the comments. This current version of the app is non-UI (all the UI portions have been commented out)
